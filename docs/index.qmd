## My Research

### Vocabulary learning

- Tests

  - Badger = ??
  
  - Á©¥ÁÜä = ??
  
## My research

- I can map the L2 and L1, but I have never seen a badger

- Do readers mentally visualize from the letters?

  - Is there any difference between L1 and L2?

## Embodied (Grounded) Cognition 

- Humans not only understand the lexical meaning of a word but also activate their accumulated sensory and motor experiences (e.g., seeing, touching) associated with that word (e.g., **Barsalou, 2008**).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("material/lemon_boy.png")
```

## Various Approaches

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("material/fivesenses.png")
```

## Embodied Cognition Research

- Experimental studies have found that linguistic processing involves non-linguistic information:

  - Shape (Vision): Reading "Eagle in the sky" elicited faster reaction times to the picture of the eagle with its wings outstretched than with its wings folded (Zwaan et al., 2002).
  
  - Scent (Olfaction): Reading scent-related words (e.g., cinnamon) increased activation in olfactory brain areas (Gonz√°lez et al., 2006).

## Most words are ground in vision?

- Lynott et al. (2020)

  - 40,000 English words were rated by native speakers

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width="150%", fig.cap="Retrieved From https://osf.io/46hjf"}
knitr::include_graphics("material/PerceptualNorms-RatingScreen.png")
```

## Lynott et al. (2020)

- Mean rating scores of **vision** were higher than other modalities

![From Lynott et al. 2020](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.3758%2Fs13428-019-01316-z/MediaObjects/13428_2019_1316_Fig3_HTML.png?as=webp)

# What is the font color?

<center>
<span style="font-size: 700%; color: blue;">Ëµ§</span>
<span style="font-size: 700%; color: white;">Ëµ§</span>
<span style="font-size: 700%; color: red;">Ëµ§</span>
</center>

## Stroop Effect
### Receiving inconsistent information causes inhibition.

-   font color - meaning of the word

## Activation of Color Information
### Connell and Lynott (2009)

- Activation of Object color information

- Semantic Stroop task
  1. Read a sentence (e.g., *Joe was excited to see a bear in the woods.*)
  2. A keyword is presented in color ( <font color="brown">**bear**</font> )
  3. Answer the color of the font

## Connell and Lynott (2009)
- Reaction times were faster when the indicated color matched the font color, compared to when they mismatched.

- Sentence (*Joe was excited to see a bear in the woods*): üêª

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("material/stroop.png")
```

## Difference Between Learning and Acquisition

![](material/acquisition_learning.png){width=100% height=100%}

## Difference Between Learning and Acquisition

- Activation of objects shape is **reduced** in second language processing (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Norman & Peleg, 2022, 2023)

## Terai (2023)
- Replicated Connell and Lynott (2009) in both the first and second language

- Interaction of second language proficiency and typicality (in the second language)

  <div style="border: #83cafc dashed 2px; font-size: 100%; padding: 15px;">Second language proficiency was operationalized using vocabulary size scores.</div>

## Influence of Task Types

- Huettig et al. (2020)

![](material/huettig_2020.png){width=100% height=100%}

## Influence of Task Types

- Huettig et al. (2020)

  - Color information was activated **when a task supported the involvement**

## The Study
### Research Questions and Hypotheses

- Does the magnitude of reaction time differences between conditions (i.e., the Stroop effect) differ between the sentence-level and word-level task?

    - PredictionÔºöSentence-level task shows larger Stroop effect

## Terai (2024)
- Word-level processing

## Analysis

### Bayesian mixed-effects models

- Dependent Variable: 

  - RT (reaction time) of the Stroop task

    - Terai (2023): Sentence-level
  
    - Terai (2024): Word-level

- Independent Variables:

  - Task type (with/without sentence presentation)

  - Typicality of font color (typical / atypical / unrelated)

  - Interaction (task type √ó typicality of font color)

- Random Effects

## Results
- A notable evidence for an interaction effect (**Task \* Typicality**)

![](material/interaction_plot.png){width=70% height=70%}

## Post-hoc Analysis
- Estimated Marginal Means
  
  - There was evidence for a Stroop effect only in the sentence-level task.

![](material/emmeans_plot.png){width=70% height=70%}

- Bars: Median, 75%, and 95% intervals

## Post-hoc Analysis
- pd: *Probability of Direction*:

  - The proportion of posterior samples that fall in the same direction (positive/negative) as the median.

![](material/emmeans_table.png){width=100% height=100%}

## Discussion
- The extent of color activation is influenced by task type.

  - Tasks that provide prior contextual information promote greater activation

  - Color activation does not always (routinely) occur

::: {.callout-note}
- Model with *Task Language* 
- Task language showed no notable main effects or interactions with other variable.

  - The effects of task type were consistent across both L1 and L2.

# Why is this important?

## Implication for embodied research

- "To what extent does embodied language processing occur routinely?" (Ostarek & Huettig, 2019)

  - Embodied knowledge might not be routinely activated

    - Huettig et al.: Word / Picture
    
    - This research: Word / Sentence
